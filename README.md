# .Net Event Sourcing

In this repository I want to convert from .NET 4 to .NET Core 5 this project that I found in this [article](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/555855/Introduction-to-CQRS). Until now I did not ask the permission of the author, I will once I will consider this work finished.

On commit 2b6e223ff2a2f315b7df641c22eb945a17bb7e37 you will find the exact code ,including pakage version numbers i.e structuremap 2.6.4.1. The only difference is that you do not have a web interfcae, but you can import the "CQRS.Demo.postman_collection.json" file from the "CQRS.Demo.postman_collection" folder.
